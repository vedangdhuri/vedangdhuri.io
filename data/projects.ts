# 🏙️ SafeCity Hub

### A Multi-Stakeholder Crime Reporting, Monitoring & Real-Time Urban Safety Management Platform

# 📖 Overview

### SafeCity Hub is a smart, integrated platform designed to improve urban safety by connecting citizens, police, and administrative authorities on a single digital system. It enables real-time crime reporting, incident monitoring, and data-driven decision-making to build safer, smarter cities.

# 🚀 Key Features
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Citizen Portal: Report crimes or safety concerns with location, images, or videos (anonymously or identified).
- 👮 Police Dashboard: Live monitoring of reported incidents, response assignment, and communication tools.
- 🏛️ Admin Panel: Analyze crime data, visualize heatmaps, and plan urban safety strategies.

# 🧩 System Architecture

### Stakeholders:
- Citizens
- Police / Law Enforcement
- Municipal & Administrative Authorities

### Stakeholders:
1. A citizen reports an incident via web/app.
2. The system logs data in the central database.
3. Police receive real-time alerts and take action.
4. Administrators access analytics for policy planning.

#### ❗ IMPORTANT Note : If you're creating a virtual environment in VS Code, choose Python version 3.6.2.

# ❗ Additional Note
In the area police station, only the police of area code 001 can view the complaints. Police from other areas (002 or 003) cannot access these complaints.

# 🔐 Security & Privacy
- End-to-end encrypted communication
- Role-based access control (Citizen, Police, Admin)
- Option for anonymous reporting
- Data protection compliant with standard security guidelines

# 💡 Future Enhancements
- AI-based crime prediction and pattern recognition
- IoT integration (smart CCTV, panic buttons)
- Chatbot for emergency help
- Integration with government databases for automated response

# 🏆 Impact
- Faster law enforcement response
- Improved citizen safety engagement
- Data-driven urban policy planning
- Transparent communication between authorities and citizens

# AES Encryption and Decryption in Java
A simple yet powerful Java application that implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to perform secure text encryption and decryption. This project demonstrates the practical use of AES symmetric key cryptography for protecting sensitive information in Java.

# 📘 Description
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing data. This project — EDcrypt — provides an educational and functional example of how AES can be implemented in Java using the built-in \`javax.crypto\` package.

# 🚀 Features
- AES 128-bit encryption and decryption
- Text-based encryption using a user-defined secret key
- Command-line interface (CLI) for user input
- Uses Base64 encoding for readable encrypted output
- Lightweight and dependency-free

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

#### Language :

#### Code Editor :

# ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequirements
- Java JDK 8 or higher installed on your system
- Basic command-line knowledge

# 💻 Usage Example

### Encrypting a Message

\`\`\`
Enter text to encrypt: Hello Vedang Enter secret key: mySecretKey123 Encrypted text: z1G7b8x+Nlq90O2ZTYbKAw==
\`\`\`

### Decrypting a Message

\`\`\`
Enter text to decrypt: z1G7b8x+Nlq90O2ZTYbKAw== Enter secret key: mySecretKey123 Decrypted text: Hello Vedang
\`\`\`

# 🧠 How It Works
1. The user provides text and a secret key.
2. The key is converted into a secure AES key.
3. The text is encrypted using AES and encoded with Base64.
4. During decryption, the process is reversed to reveal the original message.

# 🚀 Future Enhancements
- File encryption and decryption
- GUI implementation (Swing/JavaFX)
- Support for AES-256
- Key management improvements
